Description: For natural language processing and analysis of qualitative text
    coding structures which provide a way to bind together text and text data
    are fundamental. The package provides such a structure and accompanying
    methods in form of R6 objects. The 'rtext' class allows for text handling
    and text coding (character or regex based) including data updates on
    text transformations as well as aggregation on various levels.
    Furthermore, the usage of R6 enables inheritance and passing by reference
    which should enable 'rtext' instances to be used as back-end for R based
    graphical text editors or text coding GUIs.
